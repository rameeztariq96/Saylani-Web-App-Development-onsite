        <P><span class="capital">T</span>winkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
            So radiant and bright you are.<br />
            In the sky above so high,<br />
            You adorn the velvet night sky.<br />
            
            Like a diamond, you shimmer and gleam,<br />
            Illuminating our nightly dream.<br />
            Guiding us with your gentle light,<br />
            Through the vast expanse of night.<br />
            
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
            A constant presence from afar.<br />
            You bring a twinkle to our eyes,<br />
            And fill our hearts with sweet surprise.<br />
            
            As we gaze up at your celestial show,<br />
            Wondering what secrets you truly know.<br />
            Do you hold the tales of galaxies old?<br />
            Of stories yet untold, waiting to unfold?<br />
            
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
            How wondrous and mysterious you are.<br />
            You inspire us to dream and explore,<br />
            To reach for the heavens and strive for more.<br />
            
            In your twinkling, we find delight,<br />
            A captivating, enchanting sight.<br />
            Oh, twinkle on, and never cease,<br />
            Spreading your celestial peace.<br />
            
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
            A reminder of how small we are.<br />
            Yet in your light, we find our place,<br />
            A part of this cosmic dance we embrace.<br />
            
            So, twinkle on, with your pure light,<br />
            A beacon shining through the night.<br />
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
            Forever cherished, no matter where you are.<br />
