    <h1>Zinger Burger</h1>
    <p><b>Zinger burger</b> A well-seasoned, crispy fried chicken fillet slathered with a special burger sauce, topped with a slice of Cheddar cheese, finished off with Romaine lettuce and put inside a soft Broiche bun; this is what dreams are made of. 
        And I am gonna make these dreams come true with this fool-proof, incredibly mouth-watering recipe of Zinger Burger. This crunchy chicken burger is just how you get it at KFC or maybe even better</p>
