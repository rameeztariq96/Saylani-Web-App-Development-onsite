    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    <p>A <b>Chicken burger</b> are made with crispy seasoned chicken breast fillets. I just halve chicken breasts to create two thin steaks. Coat in a seasoned flour (the flour makes it nice and crispy), pan fry until golden then top with cheese to melt. Meanwhile, that the burger buns or bread rolls and prepare your toppings! I like to fry up some onion because a burger doesnt feel like a burger without onions.
        But the beauty of burgers is that you can load it up with your toppings of choice. Lettuce, tomato, pickles, beetroot, avocado, egg. Go wild!</p>
