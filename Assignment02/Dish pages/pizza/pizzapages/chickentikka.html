    <h1>Chicken Tikka</h1>
    <p> Everyone loves <b>Chicken Tikka</b> the perfect blend of mild Indian Masalas and Italian herbs topped with cheese makes this Pizza exceptional. You can add fresh Coriander leaves to give it a distinctive Desi twist. You will love my Paneer Pizza, Whole Wheat chicken Pizza and Vegetable Pizza as well. Turkish Pide or Turkish Pizza is also very tempting. </p>
