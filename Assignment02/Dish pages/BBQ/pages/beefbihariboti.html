    <h1>Beef Behari Boti</h1>
    <p>The <b>Bihari Boti</b> is also commonly known as Bihari Kabab even though Turks are known to make the first form of kababs and the Bihari boti or kababs is made with meat chunks like in the ancient times, it is nothing like the kababs that the Turks must have eaten. Instead it has upgraded to a delicious, melt-in-the mouth texture, infused with spices, yougurt and tenderising papaya.
        Its pretty evident through the name that the Bihari Boti derived from Bihar and even though Bihar is traditionally vegetarian and are known for cooking vegetable dishes to perfection.</p>
