    <h1>Chicken Tikka</h1>
    <p> While you feel like there should be a secret combo of whole Pakistani spices that give out robust <b>Tikka flavor</b>, the reality is staying away from whole spices and undermining whole spices flavors to bring out tikka flavor. 
        The smoking does a great job here. And you get a very delicious tikka flavor without excessive thirst or heartburn that comes with too much use of commercial spice mixes.
        The below recipe has a very authentic taste very much like a restaurant without premade-spice mix but you can substitute red chili flakes with spice mix if you want a sharper taste.</p>
