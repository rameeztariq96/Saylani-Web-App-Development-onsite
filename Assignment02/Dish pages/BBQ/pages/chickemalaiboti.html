    <h1>Chicken Malai Boti</h1>
    <p><b>Malai Boti</b> aka Malai Tikka are melt-in-the-mouth chunks of boneless chicken marinated in a mildly flavoured cream sauce made with fresh herbs. The chicken is so succulent and perfect to enjoy with a green chutney as an appetizer or put into parathas or wraps for a full meal. You can grill, bake or pan-fry this versatile dish!</p>
